## Experience

### __Carnegie Mellon University, Research Experiences for Undergraduate__  `2017.5 - 2017.8`
_Research Assistant_<br>
__Penrose__ is a system that automatically visualizes mathematics using two domain-specific languages: __Substance__ and __Style__. Co-advised by [Jonathan Aldrich](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./aldrich/), [Keenan Crane](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/), [Joshua Sunshine](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jssunshi/), and [Katherine Ye](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kqy/), I designed and implemented the Style language, and extended the Substance language to support functions and logically quantified statements.

### __Columbia University, Computer Graphics and User Interfaces Lab__ `2017.1 - 2017.5`
_Research Assistant_<br>
Worked with prof. Steven Feiner, on __Cyber Affordance Visualization in Augumented Reality__ project. Developed a Microsoft Hololens application that visualizes the Columbia campus in AR environment.

### __AsiaInfo__ `2015.6 - 2015.8`
_Software Engineering Intern_<br>
Worked on server-side web applications and server deployment tools.
